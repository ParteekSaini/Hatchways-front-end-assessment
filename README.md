# Project Description <br/>
1. Fetch Data from public JSON API, and present the information on the screen
2. Replicate the style of the image and gif below as close as to ideal output. The font used in the image is Raleway
3. Make the page mobile responsive, so that it works on screens of all sizes
4. Add a text input, where a user can filter the list of students by their name (including full name!)
5. Make each student have an expandable list view, so that all of their test scores may be viewed
6. The plus should be an HTML button, and if the button is clicked on, the expansion will toggle
7. Add a text input field to add tags for a specific student
8. Add another search bar to search for students based on tags
9. If a name is entered in the search by name input, and a tag is entered in the search by tag input, results that include both the name and tag should be shown
